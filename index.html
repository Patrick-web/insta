The following recursive algorithm will find both the minimum and maximum elements in an array A of n elements.

The algorithm begins by creating a temporary variable x to hold the value of the leftmost element in A. The algorithm then recursively calls itself with two arguments: a and b . The first argument is the minimum element in A, and the second argument is the maximum element in A. The function returns with two values: a , which is the position of the minimum element in A, and b , which is the position of the maximum element in A. The running time of this method is O((n+1) * log n) , where n is number of elements in A.</textarea
